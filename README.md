In order to be able to launch this project you have to have node installed from https://nodejs.org/en/

After that you are going to run the command npm install which should install the express package from the package.json file

And I also recommend installing nodemon package globally by typing the command: 
  npm install nodemon -g

After that to run the project you just type the command: 
  nodemon app.js

The project should be visible if you type in your browser localhost:5000
